## Map limitations
* The maps should not be too big, as the real map engine probably croaks with too big maps. The size you can give for the map in the editor is in meters. Sizes a big as 3 km x 3 km should be fine, depending on the amount of extra terrain.

* Infantry units are limited to a maximum of 100 men.

* Cavalry and artillery units are limited to a maximum of 60 men.

* Artillery units can also have a maximum of 10 men per gun. So a unit with 4 guns can have a minimum of 4 guns.
